# Odoro - Focus timer

If you are exploring ways to stay productive without feeling overwhelmed, Here are the two working techniques that works for you: **Pomodoro** and **Flomodoro**.

**Odoro** is a productivity app that contains the Pomodoro and Flomodoro techniques to help you manage your time effectively.

## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Here's how it works:

- Choose a task you want to work on.
- Set a timer for 25 minutes (one "Pomodoro").
- Work on the task until the timer rings.
- Take a short break (5 minutes).
- After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

## Flomodoro Technique

The Flomodoro Technique is a variation of the Pomodoro Technique, designed to be more flexible. It allows for longer work intervals and breaks, adapting to the individual's flow and energy levels. Here's a general approach:

- Choose a task to focus on.
- Set a timer for a longer interval (e.g., 45-60 minutes).
- Work on the task until the timer rings.
- Take a break (10-15 minutes).
- Adjust the intervals and breaks based on your productivity and energy.
- Both techniques aim to enhance focus and productivity by balancing work and rest periods.

## Information to users

- You can customize timing and other parameters through the settings page. Changes made here will be saved in the settings.json file.
- A settings.json file is automatically created to store your custom settings.
- A history.json file is generated after a work session is completed, but only if the history feature is enabled (disabled by default).
